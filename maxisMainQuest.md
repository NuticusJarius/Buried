### Step 3:
A lantern will appear floating in the air around the town. Throw a grenade at the lantern so that it blows the lantern up, and pick it up. Get Arthur to kill 10 zombies, and interact with the chalk drawing of the lantern on the gunsmith roof. A cipher will appear on the wall. Translate the cipher to three different phrases that can be found in the mineshaft.\

Place down a timebomb. Using the Bowie knife or Galvelknuckles, melee the three phrases in the correct order to spawn in a whisp, it will start moving towards the church. The wisp will fade away unless it passes through zombies. Once it makes it to its destination activate the timebomb and do this again.

### Step 4:
Go to the backside of the mansion and interact with the light board. This will have one of the bulbs turn yellow. Each bulb represents a bell somewhere on the map, players need to hit the bell according to which bulb is yellow. Once the bell has been hit the bulb will turn green and another will turn yellow. Do this until all bulbs are green.\

If a target is not shot the step will need to restart. If all players shoot all of their targets the step is complete.
